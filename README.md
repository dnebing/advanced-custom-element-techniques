# Advanced Custom Element Techniques

This is the public repo that goes along with my blog about Advanced Custom Element Techniques.

It really only contains one client extension, but that client extension contains all of the custom element samples.

The custom elements that I have included are:

* `<acet-props id='###'></acet-props>`: The ACET IdProps component demonstrates how we define a props custom element to accept an id. The blog post includes instructions for how to add to a page and configure.
